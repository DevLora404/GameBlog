    <h2>Day 1 – Introduction</h2>
    <p>Lora here!</p>
    <p>I am officially creating a video game from scratch on my own!</p>
    <p>Alas, I do have a problem... I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT GAME DEVELOPMENT</p>
  <p>No Blender, no Unity, no nothing. So please join me on this beautiful project — all comments, recommendations, and suggestions are welcome and appreciated, either in the Thoughts section or on my<a href="https://x.com/woo_art46167"> Twitter</a>
      <p>Stay tuned</p>

    <h2>Day 2 – Learning Blender</h2>
    <p>The idea is to create everything on my own, but with the schedule I have, that seems almost impossible, PLEASE forgive me if I use any google assets.
  Obviously I will put the link so you can see the work of the original author! </p>

    <h2>Week 1 - Slowed down</h2>
    <p>The blog has been updated and fixed! Your comments will now be public!</p>
    <p>I created some minor things, the interior and exterior of the RV still need to be detailed (SUPER IMPORTANT) </p>
    <p>Being that I am early to university, I am dividing my time between the game and getting regular on math, please be patient! </p>
    <p>If anyone wants to help me with some models, please let me know !!! </p>

    <h2>Week 2 - What to expect?</h2>
    <p>This week, there were no finished designs or major breakthroughs in Unity apart from some motion tests. I spent most of my time polishing and discarding ideas</p>
    <p>So it's time to really give a broad context of what the game will be like and how I hope it works (if everything goes well) </p>
    <p>The project is currently called Mobile Grave. The name might change in the future, though I don't think it will.</p>
    <p>
      Let Me Break It Down
    </p>
    <p> Mobile - As I mentioned last week, the RV (Recreational Vehicle) design is extremely important — not just because it’s your only means of transportation (yes, there will be no other drivable cars), but also because it's one of the few safe zones you'll find in the game.

  <p> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/">You can think of Pacific Drive as a reference point</a>.</p>
  <p>I really want you to care about the RV — to see it not just as a vehicle, but as a companion. </p>
  <p>The RV will also serve as a warehouse and a place to sleep in case the dark atmosphere of the game does not catch your attention</p>
  <p>The RV will have a system of keys and gasoline, please take care of the battery and do not forget to close the door before leaving</p>

    <p>Grave- 
      The game will be difficult. You will die. There are no save points or second chances.

I know this might limit the audience a bit (especially considering only about four people even know this project exists).

Still, I made this decision because I’m tired of overly simple games (I won’t name any).

Since there’s no difficulty selector, it’s important to understand that you’ll need to study your surroundings carefully and ask yourself: is it really worth going out?

I’m still working out the types of damage the game will include (fall damage, for example), so I can’t say exactly how many hits you can take — but I can assure you that you’ll be able to upgrade your health and shielding a bit, so it doesn’t feel unfair.

Oh, and yes — you can exit the game and save. I’m not that cruel.
    </p>
  <h2>What can I expect from gameplay? </h2>
  <p>You can expect a game with PSX graphics with the S.T.A.K.L.E.R gameplay.</p>
  <p>A game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2119830/MISERY/">MISERY</a> was recently announced , that's one of my biggest gameplay inspirations</p>
  <p>
    I have some gameplay ideas that will force you to play more slowly in certain areas — not just because your character is weak, but also due to environmental hazards.
  But I won’t go into detail yet until I have everything more clearly defined.
</p>
<p>For my part it would be everything, see you next week!</p>
